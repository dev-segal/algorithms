# Infinite Monkey Theorem

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

Here goes my implementation!

## Usage

```python

In [7]: monkey.start_typing('hola', 1000000)                                                                             
Best match: hola
Score: 4
Time elapsed: 6.30 seconds
```

OR 

```python
>>> import monkey
>>> monkey.generate('python', repeat=10000)
('ykthon', 4)
```
